### Day 9: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read 3 chapters in The Definitive Guide to javascript and learned some things about booleans and functions I didn't know.  Finished another lesson about iterators on @Codecademy and got a great idea to build a photo switcher for practice in JS this weekend!üëç

**Thoughts:** It's nice to learn new things about data values I thought I understood.  Also coming up with practice projects is a great creative outlet that provides much needed code time!
