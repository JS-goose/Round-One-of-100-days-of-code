Day 4: January 4, 2018

Today's Progress: D4 did 2 modules on Codecademy about iterators.  Practiced using these iterators on some arrays to return first letters of words or numbers above a certain value.

Thoughts: I can see how these iterators are going to be useful and I've heard that looping over arrays is a common task for JavaScript developers.
