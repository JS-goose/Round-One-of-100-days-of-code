### Day 19: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** So these inline function expressions and callbacks have been very elusive for me to understand.  I worked for a few hours trying to understand the mechanics and theory.  *Fingers crossed* I believe I may have it!

**Thoughts:**  I'm building confidence but I have to practice using this otherwise my knowledge will fade away.  Practice makes perfect!

**Today's Work** : 

function cat(catMeowFunc, numStripes) {
  catMeowFunc(numStripes);
}

kittyCat(function showCatBreed(catName) {
  console.log("My favorite cat is " + catName);
}, "monday");

//convert the below into inline function expression
function emotions(myString, myFunc) {
  console.log("I am " + myString + ", " + myFunc(2));
}
/*var laughs = "";
  for(var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
      laughs += "ha";
  }
  return laughs + "!";*/

//My answer - inline function expression  
emotions("happy", function laugh(num){
  var laughs = "";
  for(var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
      laughs += "ha";
  }
  return laughs + "!";
})
