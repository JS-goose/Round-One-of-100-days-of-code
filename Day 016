### Day 16: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Day 2 of switch statements.  I feel much more comfortable with these now.  Also, I've found that taking methodical notes is a massive boon!

**Thoughts:**  I can see how switch statements are super useful and handy when you have a result dependent on the matching of one variable to another...like a lock and key type scenario.

**Today's Work** : 
var education = "a Bachelor's degree";
var salary;

switch (education) {
  case "no high school diploma":
    salary = 25636;
    break;
  case "a high school diploma":
    salary = 35256;
    break;
  case "an Associate's degree":
    salary = 41496;
    break;
  case "a Bachelor's degree":
    salary = 59124;
    break;
  case "a Master's degree":
    salary = 69732;
    break;
  case "a Professional degree":
    salary = 89960;
    break;
  case "a Doctoral degree":
    salary = 84396;
}

console.log(
  "In 2015, a person with " +
    education +
    " earned an average of $" +
    salary.toLocaleString("en-US") +
    "/year."
);
