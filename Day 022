### Day 22: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about another type of loop, more specifically an array method called .forEach() which iterates over an array.  These puppies are slick and I like them :D

**Thoughts:** This type of loop seems to be more conscise with fewer lines of code.  Further inspection is needed in order to formulate an opinion lol  The below is a quiz that I did today.  I got the right outcome I just didn't do it specifically how the quiz asked.  After a little research I found out that the directions wanted me to change the index, not the element which was causing my syntax error.

**Today's Work** :

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Another Type of Loop (6-8)
 *
 * Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
 * that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
 *  - you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable when you're finished looping
 */

var test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4,
    19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299,
    6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139
];

// Write your code here
test.forEach(function(el,index,arr){
    if(el % 3 === 0) {
        test[index] += 100;
    }
});
