Today's Progress: Finished the Mini Linter, read another chapter on DOM manipulation in A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript.  Side note -- My other JavaScript books arived today, super excited to dig in.

Thoughts:  I had to ask for some help on Stack Overflow because I couldn't get the expected outcome I wanted.  I researched for an answer but came up with nothing.  Finally decided to make an account and ask for help.  Coming from someone who is very self sufficient, this was difficult but I'm glad I asked for help as opposed to wasting 5 hours getting nowhere.  There's nothing wrong with asking for help!
