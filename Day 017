### Day 17: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Last day of switch statements.  I got the last quiz and assignment done for switch statements about an hour ago.

**Thoughts:**  I lollygagged around a little today and didn't get as much done as I would have hoped.  My focus has been off a bit because of some personal stuff going one.  I never lose though...either I win or I learn!

**Today's Work** : 

var tSeconds = 60;
while (tSeconds >= 0) {
  switch (tSeconds) {
    case 50:
      console.log("Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power");
      break;
    case 31:
      console.log("Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start");
      break;
    case 16:
      console.log("Activate launch pad sound suppression system");
      break;
    case 10:
      console.log("Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system");
      break;
    case 6:
      console.log("Main engine start");
      break;
    case 0:
      console.log("Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff!");
      break;
    default:
      console.log(tSeconds);
  }
  tSeconds--;
}


//Long form
var tSeconds = 60;

while (tSeconds >= 0) {
  if (tSeconds === 50) {
    console.log("Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power");
  } else if (tSeconds === 31) {
    console.log("Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start");
  } else if (tSeconds === 16) {
    console.log("Activate launch pad sound suppression system");
  } else if (tSeconds === 10) {
    console.log("Activate main engine hydrogen burnoff system");
  } else if (tSeconds === 6) {
    console.log("Main engine start");
  } else if (tSeconds === 0) {
    console.log("Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff!");
  } else {
    console.log("T-" + tSeconds + " seconds");
  }
  tSeconds--;
}
