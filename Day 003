Day 3: January 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Did another 2 chapters in ASWTLJ book and learned a few more methods for DOM manipulation.  

Thoughts: Working with the DOM is highly enjoyable and I know it is important.  I just feel like there are never enough hours in the day to do everything I want --> i.e. learning new code :)
