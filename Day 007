Day 7: January 7, 2018

Today's Progress: I decided to take a small break from learning JavaScript and spent about two hours coding my tribute page for FreeCodeCamp.  It was great to do some actual coding as opposed to reading and trying out/practicing examples in the book.

Thoughts: Doing some CSS and HTML was a nice change up from JS and it's always a good feeling to work on FCC projects!
