### Day 23: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got a reintroduction to looping over array elements via the .forEach() method.  I enjoy this almost as much as the ole standby for loop except I typically forget to close my .forEach loop at the end of my statement thus throwing an error.  #Learning

**Thoughts:** Everyday I feel more confident and find myself wanting to learn.  I realized while I was standing in a line that I was running through JavaScript syntax in my head instead of looking at my phone....crazy.

**Today's Work** :

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Colors of the Rainbow (6-4)
 */

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];

// your code goes here
rainbow.splice(2, 1, "Yellow", "Green", "Purple");
console.log(rainbow);

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Quidditch Cup (6-5)
 */

// your code goes here

var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
console.log(hasEnoughPlayers(team));

function hasEnoughPlayers(team) {
    if (team.length >= 7) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Joining the Crew (6-6)
 */

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";

// your code goes here
crew.push(doctor, sister, shepherd);
console.log(crew);
