### Day 25: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished the array section of my Udacity course and moved on to objects.  I learned that these are key - value pairs of data.  I like working with them so far and the syntax seems fairly straight forward.

**Thoughts:** Objects are the last data type I need to learn about before moving on to jQuery and DOM manipulation.  I'm pumped and excited to learn how to actually change things on a website as opposed to just building static sites.

**Today's Work** :

var facebookProfile = {
  name: "Jonathan",
  friends: 228,
  messages: ["haha omg", "lol that's crazy", "no way!"],
  postMessage: function postMessage(message) {
      facebookProfile.messages.push("wow awesome!");
  },
  deleteMessage: function deleteMessage(index) {
      facebookProfile.messages.splice(index, 1);
  },
  addFriend: function addFriend() {
      facebookProfile.friends++;
  },
  removeFriend: function removeFriend() {
      facebookProfile.friends--;
  }
};
