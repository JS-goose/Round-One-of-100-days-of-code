### Day 19: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Still working with these inline function expressions.  I feel like they are making more sense but I'm still not 100% nor do I think I will ever be.

**Thoughts:**  These are so damn confusing for me, I've tried so many times to understand them.  I just have to keep plugging away at them and eventually it'll come to me.
