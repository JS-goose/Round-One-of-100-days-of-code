### Day 14: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Still working on some conditionals with Udacity and Google

**Thoughts:**  Conditionals are a very important piece to the JavaScript puzzle and I love learning about them.  I have a few projects in mind that help me practice as well.

**Today's Work** : 

var flavor = "strawberry";
var vessel = "cone";
var toppings = "cookies";

if (
  (flavor === "vanilla" || flavor === "chocolate") &&
  (vessel === "cone" || vessel === "bowl") &&
  (toppings === "sprinkles" || toppings === "peanuts")
) {
  console.log(
    "I'd like two scoops of " +
      flavor +
      " ice cream in a " +
      vessel +
      " with " +
      toppings +
      "."
  );
}
