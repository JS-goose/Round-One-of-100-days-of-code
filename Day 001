Day 1: January 1, 2018

Today's Progress: Did 3 chapters in A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript, another module in Colt Steele's boot camp, 
and wrote 3 pages of notes in my own thoughts and words on some code I didn't understand.

Thoughts: Learning new ways to iterate through arrays was interesting.  I learned about new iterating methods in JavaScript such as
.map(), .filter(), and .forEach().  I feel comfortable with these methods but not proficient yet.
