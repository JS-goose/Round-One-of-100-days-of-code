### Day 26: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked on objects problem sets and finished up the reading in that chapter.  Also finished the basic JavaScript portion of the Udacity course.

**Thoughts:** Objects are super cool and I can already think of many use cases where this data structure would fit right in.  I'm not exactly sure why but I feel confident using them.  I know the syntax fairly well and the logic computes in my brain...weird.

**Today's Work** :

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Donuts Revisited (7-6)
 */

var donuts = [
    { type: "Jelly", cost: 1.22 },
    { type: "Chocolate", cost: 2.45 },
    { type: "Cider", cost: 1.59 },
    { type: "Boston Cream", cost: 5.99 }
];

donuts.forEach(function (donut) {
    console.log(donut.type + " donuts cost $" + donut.cost + " each");
});
