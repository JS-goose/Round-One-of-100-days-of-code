### Day 27: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started jQuery section and began with selectors.  I like the syntax and feel like jQuery will help solidify my JS knowledge.

**Thoughts:** jQuery being the most popular library within JS makes sense to me, I really like it.  I've had only about 2 hours of interaction with the syntax but it seems fairly straight forward

**Today's Work** :

/*
For this quiz, use jQuery's val method to make live changes to the 'Cool Articles' <h1>!

The starter code below creates an event listener that will run any time the input changes.
For more on events, check the instructor notes.
*/


$('#input').on('change', function() {
    var val, h1;
    val = $('#input').val();
    h1 = $('.articles').children('h1');
    h1.text(val);
});


/*
For this quiz, you'll need to add to the DOM tree that already exists.

'#family2' should be a sibling of and come after '#family1'. '#bruce' should be the only immediate child
of '#family2'. '#bruce' should have two <div>s as children, '#madison' and '#hunter'.
*/

var family2 = $('<div id="family2"><h1>Family2</h1></div>').insertAfter('#family1');
$('#family2').append('<div id="bruce"><h2>Bruce</h2></div>');
$('#bruce').append('<div id="madison"><h3>Madison</h3></div>');
$('#bruce').append('<div id="hunter"><h3>Hunter</h3></div>');
