### Day 13: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started rolling through some of the conditionals parts of JavaScript in the Udacity course.  I feel like I'm learning so much and expanding my "toolkit" every day.

**Thoughts:**  I'm building confidence with each lesson but JS still isn't fully cemented in my brain....yet!

**Today's Work** : 

var balance = 325.0;
var checkBalance = true;
var isActive = false;

if (!checkBalance) {
  console.log("Thank you. Have a nice day!");
} else if (isActive && balance > 0) {
  console.log("Your balance is $" + balance + ".");
} else if (checkBalance && !isActive) {
  console.log("Your account is no longer active.");
} else if (checkBalance && balance === 0) {
  console.log("Your account is empty.");
} else {
  console.log("Your balance is negative. Please contact bank.");
}
