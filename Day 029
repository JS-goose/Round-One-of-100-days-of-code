### Day 29: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Updated <a href="https://www.powerofgoose.com">my portfolio</a> by adding some new icons and refactoring code.  Worked on a few jQuery quizzes as well.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to do some actual coding on something I care about and am invested in emotionally.  I also started writing on medium.

**Today's Work** : <a href="https://www.powerofgoose.com">My portfolio</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@joncsexton/learning-javascript-and-perspective-99e8f5dfc281">my Medium post</a>.
