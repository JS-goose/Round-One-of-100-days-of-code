### Day 28: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I finished a few quizzes on jQuery and learned how to use .each() to iterate over some DOM elements

**Thoughts:** I have virtually 0 motivation today.  It's terrible and I should be working but for some reason I cannot find the gumption to do anything else.
