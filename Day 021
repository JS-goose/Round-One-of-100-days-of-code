### Day 21: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I started with arrays today, yay!  I've been introduced to the basics a few times but I have always enjoyed these data structures.

**Thoughts:** I feel more confident with arrays than functions but maybe that's because I don't know as much about them as I do functions?

**Today's Work** :

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];

// your code goes here
rainbow.splice(2, 1, "Yellow", "Green", "Purple");
console.log(rainbow);

 /* Programming Quiz: Quidditch Cup (6-5)
 */

// your code goes here

var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
console.log(hasEnoughPlayers(team));

function hasEnoughPlayers(team) {
    if (team.length >= 7) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
