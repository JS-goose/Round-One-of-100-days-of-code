### Day 18: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** So I started functions today.  I learned a few different tricks and definitions about functions I was previously unaware of.

**Thoughts:**  I thought I had a decent grip on the theory of functions and a semi-useful knowledge on the syntax.  I was wrong lol 
I know it's a bit tricky to understand right now but with determination, motivation, and studying it will all become clear.

**Today's Work** : 

//Because who doesn't love cats?
var catSays = function(max) {
  var catMessage = "";
  for (var i = 0; i <= max; i++) {
    catMessage += "meow";
  }
  return catMessage;
};

function kitty(catSays) {
  return "Hello " + catSays(3);
}

console.log(kitty(catSays));
