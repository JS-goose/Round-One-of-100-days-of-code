Day 5: January 5, 2018

Today's Progress: worked on using iterators and array methods.  Built a simple word processor (sort of) with .filter() Read a few chapters of A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript.

Thoughts:  Iterating through arrays has proven difficult for me as I don't feel like I fully understand how iterators work.  I will definitely need more practice.
